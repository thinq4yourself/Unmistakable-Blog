The club also has a helicopter-landing pad, which makes quick travel to the resort an easy selling point.\n\nMost current members own property nearby, or have bought property from The Hermitage.

Vineyards in Burgundy are not owned by a sole proprietor.

Bordeaux, on the other hand, opts for singular ownership of its vineyards by sprawling, high visibility chateaux.  \n\nThe structure of ownership in each region also influences the classifications of their wines. Bordeaux wines are classified according to chateaux and, by extension, producers. This echoes the inaugural Bordeaux Wine Official Classification of 1855, which was requested by Napoleon III for the Great Exhibition in Paris, and ranked the region’s wines according to the reputation of their respective chateaux and trading prices. While there have been minor changes in the classification process since then, these standards still apply today. Burgundy wines are classified not by producer, but by the vineyards where the grapes are actually grown. It’s important to note, however, that a Burgundian producer’s reputation comes into play when consumers and investors are in selection mode.

Click the little pencil icon at the top of the preview to edit this post and read the next section!\n\n## Getting Started\n\nGhost uses something called Markdown for writing. Essentially, it's a shorthand way to manage your post formatting as you write!\n\nWriting in Markdown is really easy. In the left hand panel of Ghost, you simply write as you normally would. Where appropriate, you can use *shortcuts* to **style** your content. For example, a list:\n\n* Item number one\n* Item number two\n    * A nested item\n* A final item\n\nor with numbers!\n\n1. Remember to buy some milk\n2. Drink the milk\n3. Tweet that I remembered to buy the milk, and drank it\n\n### Links\n\nWant to link to a source? No problem. If you paste in a URL, like http://ghost.org - it'll automatically be linked up. But if you want to customise your anchor text, you can do that too! Here's a link to [the Ghost website](http://ghost.org). Neat.\n\n### What about Images?\n\nImages work too! Already know the URL of the image you want to include in your article? Simply paste it in like this to make it show up:\n\n![The Ghost Logo](https://ghost.org/images/ghost.png)\n\nNot sure which image you want to use yet? That's ok too. Leave yourself a descriptive placeholder and keep writing. Come back later and drag and drop the image in to upload:\n\n![A bowl of bananas]\n\n\n### Quoting\n\nSometimes a link isn't enough, you want to quote someone on what they've said. It was probably very wisdomous. Is wisdomous a word? Find out in a future release when we introduce spellcheck! For now - it's definitely a word.\n\n> Wisdomous - it's definitely a word.\n\n### Working with Code\n\nGot a streak of geek? We've got you covered there, too. You can write inline `<code>` blocks really easily with back ticks. Want to show off something more comprehensive? 4 spaces of indentation gets you there.\n\n    .awesome-thing {\n        display: block;\n        width: 100%;\n    }\n\n### Ready for a Break? \n\nThrow 3 or more dashes down on any new line and you've got yourself a fancy new divider.
